# Product-Matching
Product matching on shopee dataset (Kaggle Competition)
In the modern era, customers can buy products from hundreds of e-commerce
websites. However customers find it hard to get the similar items with good quality
and cheaper price because these items are listed at multiple websites for different
prices. Leading e-commerce companies are always in search of building robust AI
technology to make their customers comfortable in searching the products and
attract the customers to buy their products at rates competitive to sold by other
retailers in the market.

Here we present deep learning approach based on Holistically-Nested Edge Detec-
tion (HED), EfficientNet-B3 (EffNet-B3), Bidirectional Encoder Representations

from Transformers (BERT), Normalizer-Free Networks (NFNet), Vision Trans-
former (ViT), and Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to find

images and text embeddings. During model execution for a particular image, we
use KNN to get the top 50 similar products based on the embeddings which can be
used to compare the price of a product.
